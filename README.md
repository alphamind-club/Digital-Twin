# MLPA: Creating a Digital Twin of Cancer

## Overview

MLPA (Machine Learning for Precision Oncology) is a project aimed at developing a digital twin of cancer by integrating multiscale, spatial transcriptomic, and temporal data. This repository includes MATLAB scripts and data files designed to model cancer progression and response to treatments.

## Contents

- **Scripts:**
  - `camodel.m`: Main model script for cancer simulation.
  - `contour.m`: Generates contour plots for data visualization.
  - `drug.m`: Models drug interactions and effects on cancer cells.
  - `errorfinder.m`: Identifies and corrects errors in the dataset.
  - Additional scripts for data processing and analysis.

- **Data:**
  - `pathways.csv`: Contains pathway information for analysis.
  - `tumor_analysis_results.csv`: Results from tumor analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - MATLAB (version XYZ or later)

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/jamesgu888/MLPA.git
     ```
   - Add the repository to your MATLAB path:
     ```matlab
     addpath('path/to/MLPA');
     ```

3. **Usage:**
   - Run the main model script:
     ```matlab
     camodel
     ```
   - Generate visualizations:
     ```matlab
     contour
     ```
